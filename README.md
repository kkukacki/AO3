GIT/Github Tutorial

Step 1: Open command prompt, and create your desired directory, then in GIT, used the command “git init” to create a new **repository** in GIT.

Step 2: To add any files to your **repository**, use the command “git add (filename)”. Then, once you are satisfied, you can **commit** those changes using “git commit”. Alternatively, you can also use “git commit -m (message)” in order to leave a log of your changes along with the changes you have done.

Step 3: To push all the changes to your **repository**, use the command “git push origin (branchname), usually you can use “git push origin master” in order to **push** the changes to the master **branch**.

If you want to create a new **branch**, you use the command “git -b (name of branch), and to switch between **branches** you use the “git checkout (name of branch) “

If you’d like to update your local **repository**, you use the command “git **pull**”, and if you want to **merge** your changes, you can use the command “git-**merge** (branch)”
